# Module 8 -Journal Assignment
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project contains a code that reads the city name and temperature from a .txt file.
Then convert that temperature to Celcius. The Celsius temperature will be added to another .txt file.
# What did you do particularly well?
I added the file stream to read the input file and create the output .txt file.
And I have added a while loop within the if-else statement to read the input file, convert the temperature and add data to the newly created
output file.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have created a method to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Then call the function within the main. It would have increased the code readability.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part I found was using code to read data from a file. Then break down that and only take integer value to calculate.
Using C++ class fstream helped with reading, creating, and writing data to/from files.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project taught me to write code that will read and write data from files. 
I also learned the use of Stream classes in C++.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have debugged the code to ensure it is bug-free and has no syntax errors.
I have added in-line comments to help others understand what each command will do.
I have used VS code to ensure the code will be adaptable to other VCS tools.
